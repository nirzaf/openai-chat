# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

To deploy the app to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Install the `gh-pages` package as a dev dependency:

   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

2. Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```

3. Add the `homepage` field to your `package.json` file with the URL of your GitHub Pages site:

   ```json
   "homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>"
   ```

4. Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v2
           with:
             node-version: '14'

         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm install

         - name: Build the app
           run: npm run build

         - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
           run: npm run deploy
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

5. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. Your app should now be deployed to GitHub Pages. You can view it at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.
